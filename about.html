    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My interests are everywhere and I always liked to be creative, that’s why I knew that I would go in the direction of design.
        Starting with the constant decorating and rearranging my room so that everything looks coherent and lager up to a unique and homemade gifts for friends and family. I started to design a lot myself and enjoyed learning new things.
        I realized that design is more than just “making something beautful”.
        So much can be shown, expressed and conveyed in different ways.
        Wheter it’s art, music or advertising. 
        To look at things in a different point of view and thinking, to find out what is really behind it and how exactly it works.
        What techniques were there and how they could be implented.
        I want to aquire more knowledge, learn how I can implent my ideas even better, be more creative and improve myself.
        I want to see what my strenghs are, what I should work on more or what I should rather repeat once again.</p>
